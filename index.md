## About
I am currently serving in National Institute for Mathematical Sciences (NIMS) as technical research personnel for compulsory military service of South Korea. Before I joined NIMS, I was a Ph.D. student in mathematics at MIT.

My advisor is 
<a href="http://www-math.mit.edu/~poonen/">
    Bjorn Poonen
</a>
, and I will return to the school in Fall 2018 as a third year graduate student. My interests lie in algebraic geometry and number theory.
